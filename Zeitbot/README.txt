------------ USING GIFS ---------------
To add the Gif-Window to OBS use a window-capture.
The background of the gifs' window is Colorcode (0,0,0).
Make sure to use a filter for this color.

To add a gif follow these steps:
	1. Put the .gif file into the "gifs" folder
	2. If the gif has a sound, put the corresponding .mp3 file into the "gifs" folder. Make sure it has the EXACTLY same name as the .gif file.
	3. Start the bot and click the "Add Gif" button. 
		-If you got a soundfile use the syntax Gifname;Cost
		-Else use the syntax Gifname;Duration;Cost
	4. Enjoy the gif by calling it with !Gifname
